# Dates with Chopped Pistachios

## Ingredients
* Dates
* Walnuts, almonds, or pecans.
* Creme fraiche.
* Orange or lemon zest.
* Chopped pistachios. 

## Instructions
1. Cut each date down one side, extract pit.
2. Halve dates.
3. Press walnuts (or almonds or pecans) into the center of each date. (You can also try to flatten the date a bit, which helps keep the toppings from falling off.)
4. Add a dollop of creme fraiche on top.
5. Sprinkle chopped pistachios and citrus zest on top.
